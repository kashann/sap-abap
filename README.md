# SAP ABAP technology
```
SAP stands for Systems, Applications & Products in Data Processing. SAP AG is a
German multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software to manage business
operations and customer relations. In present, SAP is the most important ERP program
worldwide.

SAP is very complex, being helpful in business services and technological solutions for
accountancy, customer relations management (CRM), supply chains, banking, insurance, etc.

SAP is the world leader in enterprise applications in terms of software and software-related
service revenue. Based on market capitalization, it is the world’s third largest independent software
manufacturer and the largest business software manufacturer.

SAP ERP is a sistem based on a 3 layer architecture:
- Presentation server – GUI
- Application server – data processing using ABAP
- Database – storing data

We used two connections / systems in SAP:
- IDES 3.0 – Internet Demonstration and Evaluation System
- SAP NetWeaver BW 7.4 – Business Warehouse + BI platform

The SAP GUI window is composed of:
- Menu Bar
- Command Bar
- Standard Toolbar
- Title Bar
- Application Toolbar
- Status bar

The SAP Easy Acces menu is composed of:
- Logistics
- Accounting
- Human resources
- Production planning
- Distribution
- Retail
- Production
- Banking

## Transactions in SAP
The code of a transaction is an alphanumeric combination of 4-5 characters. This can be
used instead of following the whole path from the menu.

The transactions that I learned & used during my internship are:
- SE11 – ABAP Dictionary
- SE38 – ABAP editor (code)
- RSO2 – Extractor (Data Source)
- RSA3 – Data Source Tester
- RSA1 – BW Workbench

>ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming) is a high-level programming
language created by SAP, that is used in SAP GUI. It is currently positioned, alongside Java, as
the language for programming the SAP Application Server, which is part of the NetWeaver
platform for building business applications.

>ABAP Dictionary (SE11) is the place where system metadata is created and modified. Here
we define global data types, that can be used later for defining database objects or declaring
variables in ABAP programs.

## Conclusion
```
SAP ABAP is an optimal solution for managing a business, covering a very large area of
business processes that are met in medium companies and includes manufacturing specific
functionalities. With SAP, you can optimize processes, based on the experience of the most
successful companies, having integrated advanced analysis tools and personalized raports, so that
you can have an overview of all the activities of the company, to be able to take fast and efficient
decisions.
